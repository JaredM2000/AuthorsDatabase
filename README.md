Run "bash serverSetup.txt" this will create a Node folder in your home directory.
Then copy the service.js, and integration.js files to the Node folder
The index.js should have been copied over already from the script, but if it isn't copy that one too
Finally while in the Node folder run "sudo node index.js" Your server is now running.
